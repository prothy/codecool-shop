# Codecool shop

This project is a school project where our task was to create a basic shop in two week-long sprints. Since this was more a Java OOP project we were initially supposed to use Tymeleaf, a templating engine, however we opted for React as we felt we were ready to try it out. In the first sprint, which you can find on the `master` branch, my personal contribution amounts more or less to the shopping cart's code and some pair programming on the rest -- we made sure to keep each other up to date on the progress we made. 

In the second sprint I contributed solely to the backend, beginning with implementing Log4J (a logging tool), beginning to write tests (which we didn't progress in as much as we'd hoped, due to time constraints), and writing implementations of the DAO classes my teammates created in the first sprint using JDBC.

Also here are some images that we created in the process of planning this application.

First, the UML diagram for the backend:

And herewith a couple of design files that I created in Figma. We more or less followed the structure, but freestyled a bit when it came to the actual implementation:
